## Custom tags

- `(color=color_name)`: Colors the text with the specified color.
- `(b)`: Makes the text bold.
- `(br)`: Inserts a line break.
- `(p)`: Inserts a paragraph.
- `(h1)`: Inserts a heading.
- `(center)`: Centers the text.


Here are some examples of how to use the custom tags:

- `(color=red)This text is red(color_)`

- `(br)`: Inserts a line break.
- `(p)This text is in a paragraph.(p_)`
- `(h1)This text is a heading.(h1_)`

Note: Make sure to include the closing tags (e.g. `(color_)`, `(b_)`, `(h1_)`, `(center_)`) to indicate the end of the styled text.
